# Netflix Clone Project

This is a Netflix Clone project created using HTML5 and CSS. The project replicates the user interface and design of the Netflix homepage, providing a clean and responsive layout. The goal of this project was to practice and improve my front-end development skills by recreating the look and feel of a popular streaming platform.

Features Included:
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.
Header Section: Includes a logo, language selection button, and a sign-in button.
Hero Section: Displays a promotional message with an email sign-up form for users to create or restart their membership.
Features Section: Highlights key Netflix features, such as watching on multiple devices, offline downloads, and kids' profiles.
FAQ Section: Uses an accordion-style dropdown to answer common questions about Netflix services.
Footer Section: Contains links to various resources like account settings, help center, and terms of use.
Technical Highlights:
Used HTML5 for the page structure.
Styled the project using CSS to achieve a professional and polished design.
Applied flexbox and grid for a consistent and responsive layout.
Ensured cross-browser compatibility and optimized the design for both desktop and mobile devices.
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of HTML5 and CSS while learning how to implement real-world UI patterns
